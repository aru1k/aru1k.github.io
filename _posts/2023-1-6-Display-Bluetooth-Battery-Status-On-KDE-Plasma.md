title: Display Bluetooth Battery Status On KDE Plasma
---

({{ site.baseurl }}/images/bluetooth-battery.png)

  KDE Plasma not showing bluetooth battery. And it's quite annoying when in the middle of work your bluetooth battery suddenly runs out. I experience it quite often.
  Actually KDE Plasma has that feature but it's not enabled by default. This feature was introduced from KDE Plasma 5.15 Beta. Quoting from the [KDE official announcement](http://github.com/barryclark/jekyll-now/)
